[00:00.000 → 00:05.919]
Okay, so this should be relatively simple for you.

[00:05.919 → 00:16.559]
I'm trying to duplicate some of my scenarios in Make and I'm trying to create workflows

[00:16.559 → 00:19.760]
in 8n.

[00:19.760 → 00:23.920]
So this was pretty straightforward.

[00:23.920 → 00:29.600]
It pings a drive every 10 minutes or so, looks for a new file.

[00:29.600 → 00:40.399]
And then when it finds a file, it will download the file and then send it to Gemini.

[00:40.399 → 00:49.280]
And then Gemini will extract the action items based on this prompt.

[00:49.359 → 01:00.240]
And then it will also create a name, a five to seven word title.

[01:00.240 → 01:06.640]
And then once it's done, it'll send all of that to me via email.

[01:06.640 → 01:10.040]
The action items will be listed right here.

[01:10.040 → 01:15.239]
And then there's also a link to the actual file.

[01:15.239 → 01:18.439]
This file right here, there's a link to the file.

[01:18.480 → 01:22.000]
And then, I guess this is it.

[01:22.000 → 01:24.640]
Oh, that's the name of the file.

[01:24.640 → 01:28.519]
That's the link to the file.

[01:28.519 → 01:30.599]
I don't know why this is in here twice.

[01:30.599 → 01:31.599]
That's weird.

[01:31.599 → 01:32.599]
I don't know.

[01:32.599 → 01:35.359]
But I don't know what the heck I'm doing half the time.

[01:35.359 → 01:36.359]
But it works.

[01:36.359 → 01:37.359]
This works.

[01:37.359 → 01:38.359]
It works perfectly.

[01:38.359 → 01:40.200]
Everything works exactly like how it should.

[01:40.200 → 01:43.640]
I'm just trying to duplicate this in Make.

[01:43.640 → 01:48.200]
Whoops, I'm sorry, 8n and I'm stuck.

[01:48.200 → 01:52.799]
So I've got the Google Drive trigger here.

[01:52.799 → 01:58.480]
And I have this set for every five minutes to check the folder.

[01:58.480 → 02:03.359]
And then once it does that, I put this Google Drive download here.

[02:03.359 → 02:08.120]
I have no idea what to use here.

[02:08.120 → 02:12.560]
Because it says file by ID and it says JSON ID.

[02:12.560 → 02:15.159]
I have no idea what to do with that.

[02:15.159 → 02:17.960]
Do I use by ID or by URL?

[02:18.439 → 02:21.400]
And then do I put, where is it?

[02:21.400 → 02:24.680]
Do I put like this URL?

[02:24.680 → 02:26.319]
I don't know.

[02:26.319 → 02:28.360]
Text plane.

[02:28.360 → 02:30.159]
Yeah.

[02:30.159 → 02:36.960]
So yeah, so I'm uploading transcripts into this folder.

[02:36.960 → 02:44.319]
I want this execution or this workflow to scan the folder, download the file, send it

[02:44.360 → 02:50.000]
over to ChatGPT.

[02:50.000 → 02:55.759]
And I put this message, prompt, roll your expert meeting, note taker, blah, blah, blah.

[02:55.759 → 03:04.680]
But what I don't know how to do is I don't know how to tell it what to, you know, like

[03:04.680 → 03:10.360]
these were these things called.

[03:10.360 → 03:13.240]
Right here, file data.

[03:13.240 → 03:15.120]
So this is the data.

[03:15.120 → 03:18.280]
This is like the actual file itself.

[03:18.280 → 03:23.599]
And it sends the file over to Chat.

[03:23.599 → 03:29.240]
Max output totally.

[03:29.240 → 03:33.360]
Yeah, so I just, I don't know how to do that here.

[03:33.360 → 03:35.879]
Let's see here.

[03:35.879 → 03:42.400]
Output content is JSON message, a model.

[03:42.400 → 03:49.199]
Yeah.

[03:49.199 → 03:51.759]
So it's supposed to get the action items.

[03:51.759 → 04:04.960]
And then this one is supposed to create the title, five to seven word title.

[04:04.960 → 04:07.319]
Simplify output.

[04:07.319 → 04:11.120]
I don't know.

[04:11.120 → 04:16.560]
So this is supposed to take the exact same call, the transcript from here and create

[04:16.560 → 04:18.560]
a title from it.

[04:18.560 → 04:29.120]
And again, I don't know where we get that execute previous nodes.

[04:29.120 → 04:34.680]
Usually outputs the following fields.

[04:34.680 → 04:36.199]
Google Drive trigger.

[04:36.199 → 04:43.800]
Google Drive download.

[04:43.800 → 04:48.639]
Name.

[04:48.639 → 04:50.319]
There may be more fields.

[04:50.319 → 04:57.439]
Execute the node to be sure.

[04:57.439 → 05:02.439]
Execute this one.

[05:03.000 → 05:08.839]
Yeah, that's it.

[05:08.839 → 05:11.759]
Yeah.

[05:11.759 → 05:14.879]
Download.

[05:14.879 → 05:18.439]
Data.

[05:18.439 → 05:25.439]
Download.

[05:25.439 → 05:28.040]
How do I get, yeah, I don't know how to do this.

[05:28.040 → 05:36.800]
How do I get to send this transcript over to chat and then to get the action items and

[05:36.800 → 05:48.759]
then this is supposed to name a file.

[05:48.759 → 05:53.360]
Yeah, I don't know how to do this.

[05:53.360 → 05:56.759]
This is where I need your help.

[05:56.839 → 06:01.120]
So separately, why is this asking me to upgrade?

[06:01.120 → 06:07.279]
I thought I didn't have to do that being that this was self-hosted.

[06:07.279 → 06:10.439]
I'm confused about that.

[06:10.439 → 06:12.319]
Okay, let me know.

[06:12.319 → 06:16.720]
You should have access to this if you don't let me know, but you should have access.

[06:16.720 → 06:24.800]
I'm trying to get this Fathom transcription node or workflow working.
